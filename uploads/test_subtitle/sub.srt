17
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,710
key questions first whether a statute

18
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,330
prohibiting an individual from

19
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,070
possessing a firearm if he's been

20

punishable by more than two years of

22

imprisonment violates the Second

23
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,869
Amendment and second whether a statue

24
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:34,850
prohibiting individuals from publishing

25
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,729
CAG files on the internet that can be

26
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:39,979

27
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:42,470

the court my name is max Kajal and on

58
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,000
behalf of petitioner Ian groves I will

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,980
address the First Amendment issue we

60
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,540
would like to reserve three minutes for

61
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,110
rebuttal

62
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:36,110
thank you two years ago mr. groves

63
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,760
created a digital design for a

64
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,580
single-shot plastic firearm following

65
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,320
instructions provided by groves that

66
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,600
design can be used to 3d print a set of

67
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,730
parts which can then be assembled into

68
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,920
the firearm although similar designs

69
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,720
have been accessible online for years

70
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,850
Ames is the only state in the nation to

71
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,830
have made it a felony to publish such

72
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,080
designs on the internet that law

73
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,000
violates the First Amendment for three

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,040
reasons first under this Court's

75
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,810
precedents in Bar Nicky and Free Speech

76
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,240
Coalition the law impermissibly targets

77
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,370
groves a speech to prevent third parties

78
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,710
criminal conduct second the law is

79
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,930
significantly over-inclusive because it

80
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,580
prevents grouse from sharing his design

81
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,560
with the many citizens of Ames who will

82
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,959
not put it to harmful uses third and

83
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,610
finally the law is a facially

84
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,950
content-based regulation of speech that

85
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,930
the state has not justified as actually

86
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,120
necessary to solve a current problem

87
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,670
counselor why should we our our

88
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,880
established precedent isn't this a new

89
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,450
form of technology your honor given that

90
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,090
it is shouldn't we be thinking about it

91
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,320
in a different way

92
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,110
your us is the first bit of technology

93
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,020
that I've ever seen that can direct

94
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:52,190
another machine to create an item that

95
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,130
could be put to dangerous use

96
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,600
Your Honor several points on that first

97
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,230
I think with respect this is an old kind

98
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,500
of speech it's a blueprint it's a design

99
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,210
foreign object the difference is that on

100
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,520
the user and a person now has access to

101
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,600
technology expensive technology that can

102
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,310
following the directions of giving it's

103
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,740
giving this technology can be used to

104
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,700
give a machine directions on how to

105
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,620
manufacture a dangerous item is very

106
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,800
different than any blueprint that we've

107
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,639
permitted in the past

108
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,960
those blueprints require an individual

109
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,900
to actually follow them assemble all of

110
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,330
the mechanisms necessary to put them

111
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,550
into effect it's one thing to build a

112
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,620
building you've got to get a lot of

113
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,810
things to build that building here all

114
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,270
you need is a 3d printer essentially

115
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,770
we're hundred I think you need the 3d

116
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,090
printer I think you also need the

117
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,279
appropriate raw materials you also need

118
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:54,379
a significant amount of technical

119
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:56,180
know-how to know how to operate it no

120
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,319
doubt it's easier than building a

121
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,939
building but we still submit there's

122
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:01,129
quite a bit of knowledge and expertise

123
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:02,509
that goes into the downloader side

124
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:05,750
before a person can take this this file

125
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,210
and turn it into a working firearm in

126
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,409
particular your honor it's our

127
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:11,029
submission as we say in our brief that

128
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:13,520
the kind of file is that our client

129
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,529
wants to upload to the internet actually

130
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:17,479
cannot direct a 3d printer to do

131
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:19,250
anything at all they need to be altered

132
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,680
on the downloader end as we say in our

133
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,139
opening brief sliced before they can

134
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:25,879
actually communicate to a 3d printer and

135
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,469
we think that makes that make some

136
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:29,089
difference these really are nothing more

137
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,759
than digital versions of blueprints or

138
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,889
of other descriptions visual or

139
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:35,960
otherwise of objects and so we think

140
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,250
it's better to think of this as the

141
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,169
dissemination of those kinds of

142
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:41,300
blueprints and that we think under this

143
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,279
Court's precedents in Sorel and in

144
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,839
bartnick II the dissemination of that

145
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,520
kind of truthful information is

146
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,279
protected speech and the fact that it

147
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,169
can be used on the downloader end and

148
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:53,689
put to unlawful ends if the person so

149
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:56,149
chooses doesn't change that fact why is

150
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:59,919
it that your clients made a CAD that

151
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,490
students require the use of a metal part

152
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,789
so detectors could work on it I know

153
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:12,139
that he has a metal a slot in which a

154
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:15,229
metal part can be placed but isn't his

155
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:17,689
intent to actually facilitate the

156
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:20,629
illegal transport of a gun through

157
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:23,210
security Your Honor I don't think that's

158
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,849
mr. Gross's intent he did it wasn't his

159
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:28,819
intent why didn't he make a pedal piece

160
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:31,759
a necessary part of the gun Your Honor

161
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,349
the record is not clear on that and I'm

162
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:35,000
not sure why he didn't but he did I

163
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,709
think do everything an uploader of this

164
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:38,899
kind of information could do to ensure

165
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:40,849
that when it was 3d printed the firearm

166
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:42,370
would be metal detectable

167
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,350
because as the record reflects at the

168
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,900
joint appendix 18 the design includes a

169
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,820
hole where a metal slug can be inputted

170
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,560
and indeed but it has no functional use

171
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,660
that's right your honor but it's our

172
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,040
understanding that it would be difficult

173
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,490
I think to to require that too to make

174
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,930
the metal piece be used but it's our

175
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,330
required your honor that's one of the

176
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,889
less restrictive alternatives that we

177
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:07,990
that we suggest is it wouldn't that be a

178
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,699
violation of the First Amendment you'd

179
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:13,120
be up here arguing that we were forcing

180
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,100
him to speak in the way he didn't want

181
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,990
to speak your honor I don't think that

182
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,729
we would be saying that this was a sort

183
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:20,440
of sort of compelled speech situation

184
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,820
and you'll write that under the

185
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,320
principles your honor is correct and

186
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,970
under the principles we think resolve

187
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,530
this case in Ashcroft and free and

188
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,830
Bartnik II that it would be still going

189
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,589
after groves is speech because some

190
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:34,210
third person quite apart from that

191
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,099
speech would be using it to commit a

192
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,110
criminal act it's important to note here

193
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,270
that just as it would be a third

194
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,520
person's independent choice to take this

195
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,380
firearm once it was assembled and use it

196
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,850
to commit a crime it's also an

197
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,200
independent choice on the part of the

198
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,390
downloader to choose not to insert the

199
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,490
metal slug that grouse has instructed

200
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,310
people who download this firearm to do

201
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:58,810
so we think either way that this is

202
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,240
still going after speech because the

203
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,459
government is worried that some

204
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,050
listeners for that speech will put it to

205
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,790
unlawful uses and that gets to the

206
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,350
second core point I would like to make

207
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,120
about this law being significantly

208
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,100
over-inclusive we think this law is

209
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,279
really no different than regulating all

210
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,990
leafleting to prevent littering of

211
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,850
course some recipients of leaflets as

212
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,020
this court said in the Schneider case

213
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,390
will put it to the littering use but

214
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,310
where the state retains the power to go

215
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,350
after littering primarily it is not

216
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,390
allowed to go after the leafleting even

217
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,680
though that would perhaps be a slightly

218
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,150
more effective way of advancing their

219
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,520
goals you could you speak to the import

220
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,890
of the statutes restriction on

221
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:38,440
publication to the internet other modes

222
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,600
of publication are made available you've

223
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,040
made an argument that making the schema

224
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,560
schematics available is important to

225
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,420
artistic and scientific and

226
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,709
entertainment serves other kind of

227
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:54,070
communicative values but your client has

228
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,089
available to him

229
00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:57,009
their means of publication that is

230
00:09:57,009 --> 00:10:03,180
offline sharing and just less broad and

231
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,180
perhaps unobservable ways of serving

232
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,939
those other purposes while mitigating

233
00:10:09,939 --> 00:10:13,720
the risk that would be created by

234
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,120
Internet publication Wyson this is just

235
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,259
a kind of time place and manner

236
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:19,329
restriction that's tolerable in the

237
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:21,339
study circumstances sure your honor two

238
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:23,259
points on that first and foremost we do

239
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:25,420
not submit it's it's properly analyzed

240
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,709
as a time place manner restriction

241
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,300
because it's our submission that it's a

242
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,009
facially content-based regulation of the

243
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:32,050
speech and as this court said precisely

244
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,089
on point in the reno case if it is a

245
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:36,220
content-based regulation of speech than

246
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,680
even regulating various modalities of

247
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,329
internet communication as the court said

248
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:42,129
is not permissible because time place

249
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:43,749
manner analysis is not permissible for

250
00:10:43,749 --> 00:10:46,120
facially content-based regulations but

251
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,889
your honor brings up an important point

252
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:49,389
about the use of the internet here and I

253
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:52,449
think the one piece of communication

254
00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:54,459
that really can't be achieved by not

255
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:55,870
being able to share this with all the

256
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,089
citizens of Ames who will put it to

257
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:00,850
lawful and valuable uses is that the

258
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,550
Internet as this court said in Reno is a

259
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,529
more powerful soapbox than ever before

260
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:06,939
and as this court said in packing ham

261
00:11:06,939 --> 00:11:09,429
just just two terms ago is is the

262
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:12,040
probably the most important way now that

263
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,689
citizens share information with each

264
00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:16,179
other both to speak and to listen does

265
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:19,360
this statute prevents you from putting

266
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,059
up a website that would say that you

267
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:24,279
would send this to anyone who wants it

268
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:26,949
and then sending it in a drive to

269
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:29,649
somebody this does that is that

270
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:31,839
prohibited Your Honor I think that's

271
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,759
probably not prohibited I think

272
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,439
certainly I don't think the state thinks

273
00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:36,490
that would be prohibited and since

274
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,370
that's what they argue and I don't think

275
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,990
that would be making the file itself

276
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,490
available on the internet which i think

277
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:45,759
is what the statute requires I'm sorry

278
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:51,339
why wait on a website you list that you

279
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:54,610
have this CAD program if you want to ask

280
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,949
us first tell us who you are right and

281
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,629
your honor our submission would be if we

282
00:11:58,629 --> 00:11:59,889
understand the statute correctly that's

283
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:02,589
not covered by the statute exactly so

284
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,350
why isn't that an adequate alternative

285
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,570
why it's not being barred

286
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,850
website at all well first I think it's

287
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,800
the adequate alternatives analysis would

288
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,390
only matter if this law were evaluated

289
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,770
under intermediate scrutiny rather than

290
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,150
strict scrutiny we should which we

291
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,430
submit it should not be but second I

292
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,810
think there is still something quite

293
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:21,620
different well this is not quite speech

294
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,620
its speech that acts so why should it be

295
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,540
subject to strict scrutiny well your

296
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,010
honor our it's our submission that it is

297
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,810
speech and it's protected speech because

298
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,630
the Act criminalized by the statute is

299
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:36,600
not the use of this file or directing a

300
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,890
3d printer to do anything

301
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,960
it's the publication the dissemination

302
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,600
of this design of this blueprint from

303
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,700
person to person using the Internet as a

304
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,440
medium and we submit just as this court

305
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,870
said in Bartnik II and in Sorrell it

306
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,820
strongly suggested that when a person

307
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,590
has information especially truthful

308
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,120
information and is prevented from

309
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,920
disseminating it as they see fit that's

310
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,780
a restriction on their right to speak

311
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,480
are you saying this is a purse a prior

312
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,880
restraint on speech Your Honor we don't

313
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,440
evaluate it under a prior restraint

314
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,530
approach because unlike the the use of

315
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,000
the export regulations and the defense

316
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,640
distributed case this simply imposes a

317
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,800
quite severe criminal penalty so that's

318
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,720
after the fact you're not enjoined in

319
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,580
any way there hasn't been an injunction

320
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,320
and we don't think the statute provides

321
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,570
for that no but we still think just like

322
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:24,660
the use of the the ITAR law in the

323
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,950
defence distributed case this is a

324
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,810
content-based regulation of speech and

325
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:28,950
should thus be subject to strict

326
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:29,640
scrutiny

327
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,080
well these only been around for a long

328
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,930
time and maybe that's you I think you

329
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,510
think that's a plus but have any courts

330
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,880
grappled with these issues Your Honor

331
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,410
the defense distributed litigation in

332
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,880
the Fifth Circuit I think did grapple

333
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,100
with it but the district court there

334
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,900
really didn't analyze the First

335
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,820
Amendment issue very much at all they

336
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,710
because it was a prior restraint and

337
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,300
because the plaintiffs there were

338
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,340
seeking an injunction the court really

339
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,400
focuses an analysis on the preliminary

340
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,410
injunction factors and really ended up

341
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,970
saying that at least in that case the

342
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,880
United States government's interest in

343
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,410
preventing the dissemination of those

344
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,690
files overseas really overcame any

345
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,160
analysis here but really it's a quite

346
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,290
different case here precisely because

347
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,640
the rights to receive this information

348
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,310
of citizens and aims are also being

349
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,900
violated by this law and this Court has

350
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,150
said consistently that the First

351
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,560
Amendment protects not just the rights

352
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,310
of speech

353
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,410
but also of listeners and this gets back

354
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,420
to justice carnies question about the

355
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,880
use of the Internet we think preventing

356
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,900
the dissemination of this information

357
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,370
over the Internet

358
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,950
really does burden heavily the Rights of

359
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,660
Persons and aims who are going to put

360
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,790
this information to lawful and valuable

361
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,650
uses let me interrupt for just a minute

362
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:40,260
I mean is your position following up on

363
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,420
justice Sotomayor's question is your

364
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,070
position that the fact that there is a

365
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:47,730
significant functional aspect to the CAD

366
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:50,400
files that are downloadable albeit with

367
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,440
additional expertise and action by the

368
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,990
receiver is it your position that has no

369
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,730
effect on our analysis that this is

370
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,130
purely a content-based speech regulation

371
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,830
and we should overlook the technological

372
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,360
aspects of the information that's being

373
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,100
conveyed your honor right I think that

374
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,080
is our submission and for two important

375
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,000
reasons I think it would be a mistake to

376
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,130
follow the Corley court and other courts

377
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,110
that considered speech the courts the

378
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,270
state the state addresses in their brief

379
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,310
and diminished the protection of this

380
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,589
speech exempt it from the normal

381
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:20,850
presumption against the

382
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,260
constitutionality of content-based

383
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,610
restrictions we think that would be the

384
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:26,610
case for two reasons first Reid made

385
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,770
very clear that the before we get to the

386
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,839
government's purpose in looking at

387
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:32,130
whether a law is content-based or

388
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,960
content neutral we first have to ask

389
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,089
whether it is facially content-based on

390
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:37,950
its face or not and we submit this law

391
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,660
is facially content-based on its face

392
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,030
quite clearly it only prescribes

393
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,190
publication of this information if it

394
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,110
describes a certain kind of firearm so

395
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,880
that's clearly facially content-based

396
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,180
but again regardless of its functional

397
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:55,850
purpose so if it were a recipe to create

398
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:00,270
some toxic drug it's still a recipe no

399
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,950
more than that and they should overlook

400
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,839
the other aspects and the state is

401
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,780
misguided than in your view in pointing

402
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:10,260
out that the ready availability of this

403
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,370
recipe could undermine its whole gun

404
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,080
regulation scheme for in terms of

405
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,330
tracking guns and so on your honor it

406
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,010
has no import at all in your view I

407
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,510
think that's right your honor because I

408
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,800
think the state's interest would be the

409
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,839
same if it wanted to go after the

410
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:26,820
publication of gunsmithing manuals in

411
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,650
books they would still have a fear that

412
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,200
persons would be able to as we say in

413
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,730
our brief order unfinished lower

414
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:33,900
receivers and all of the

415
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,280
the necessary parts from the internet

416
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,690
which they can now do completely

417
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,790
unregulated and assemble those firearms

418
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,380
I think the interest would be the same

419
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,530
does it matter that your clients version

420
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:46,590
is not a fully functional version that

421
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:50,160
it requires some the end-user to have

422
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,560
the right software to download it

423
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,900
properly I think it matters to the

424
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,460
analysis of whether or not this is

425
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,020
speech that's itself integral to

426
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,430
criminal conduct

427
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:02,790
perhaps if this firearm if this was

428
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,859
essentially equivalent to the

429
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,660
distribution of the firearm itself if

430
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,400
there really was no difference and no

431
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,319
distance between the act of uploading

432
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,060
this file to the internet and the and

433
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,410
then the downloader having a working

434
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,780
firearm in their hand perhaps we would

435
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,010
say that it is essentially the

436
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,720
distribution of a firearm there is a

437
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,990
difference because doesn't themes have a

438
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,849
law that you have to register any

439
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:27,359
firearm that you possess Your Honor I'm

440
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,910
not aware of that law if that law exists

441
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:32,040
I do not believe it does i understanding

442
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,870
is in a names just like under federal

443
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,150
law if one manufactures a firearm for

444
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,950
home use only then it does not need to

445
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,560
be registered or serialized but indeed

446
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,420
it's your honor raises an important

447
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,720
point that other states have

448
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,340
requirements just like that as we say in

449
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,840
our brief at our opening brief at page

450
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,360
36 the state of California has responded

451
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,700
to the problem of potential 3d printing

452
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,770
of firearms by requiring the

453
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,570
serialization and registration of any

454
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,910
firearm plastic are not manufactured at

455
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,560
home and it's our understanding this

456
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,820
just happened recently that New Jersey

457
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,280
is about to pass a law that would outlaw

458
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,170
the 3d printing of firearms altogether

459
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,970
now it's our submission and our third

460
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,710
argument is that where other

461
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,380
jurisdictions have seen that less speech

462
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,420
restrictive alternatives are effective

463
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,040
and work that raises a strong

464
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,480
presumption as this court put it in the

465
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,940
McCullen case that the state has formed

466
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,640
scuse me how do we know that they work

467
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,920
well your honor it raises an inference

468
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,570
that they work because these files have

469
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,940
been online for five years as we say

470
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,800
since Cody Wilson first put his files on

471
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,700
the internet they've been easily

472
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,980
findable the states have really seen no

473
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,860
problems at least with single-shot

474
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,260
plastic firearms and because other

475
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,700
jurisdictions have seen that they're

476
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,890
able to to achieve their interest or at

477
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,050
least think that they will in the last

478
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,530
couple of years not by going

479
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,090
after speech as the state of aims is

480
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,770
done here so we have to wait until

481
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:53,800
people are murdered your I can't

482
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,090
the shooter can't be traced and there's

483
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:02,560
no way of detecting who the perpetrator

484
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,920
is before states can take a prophylactic

485
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,510
measure to protect themselves Your Honor

486
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,920
we don't think the state has to wait for

487
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,420
people to be murdered it's our

488
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,710
submission that where we've provided

489
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,620
many reasons why bad actors are really

490
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,810
unlikely to use 3d printing as a way to

491
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,400
circumvent the law they have other means

492
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,020
at their disposal the state has

493
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,000
especially its strict scrutiny heavy

494
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,100
burden to overcome to show that it in

495
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,180
fact that is not the case

496
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,650
thank you we ask this court reverse

497
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,270
[Music]

498
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,660
you may proceed madam Chief Justice and

499
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,340
may it please the court my name is

500
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,350
Katherine McCaffrey and on behalf of

501
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,210
petitioner Ian groves I will address the

502
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:01,809
Second Amendment issue 15 years ago mr.

503
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:03,070
groves committed a non-violent crime

504
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,840
which was classified by the state of

505
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,700
aims as a misdemeanor and for which he

506
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,700
received no jail time today aim seeks to

507
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,290
enforce a statute that would prevent him

508
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,330
from possessing any type of firearm for

509
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,820
any purpose for the rest of his life the

510
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,440
statute is unconstitutional as applied

511
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,440
to mr. groves for two reasons first it

512
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,630
is a complete and permanent deprivation

513
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,220
of his fundamental right to bear arms

514
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,020
and those should be subject to per se

515
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,809
invalidation second at the very least

516
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:31,090
the state cannot justify the burden at

517
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:34,210
this ban imposes can I back you up a

518
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:38,919
moment there are only two states left

519
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:42,880
maybe just one that banned felons from

520
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,929
ever voting and we've upheld those bans

521
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:51,040
as the prerogative of the states why is

522
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,070
it that the mere conviction of an

523
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:57,790
individual is not a forfeiture or waiver

524
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,640
of entitlement to certain constitutional

525
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,370
rights including this one the possession

526
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,740
of a firearm what makes this any

527
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,320
different than the fundamental right to

528
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,120
vote we permit states to ban that

529
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,200
fundamental right why shouldn't we

530
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,230
permit the government to ban the right

531
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:23,770
to own a firearm because your honor as

532
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,630
this court said in Heller the scope of

533
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,040
the Second Amendment is set by the

534
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,750
original public understanding of the

535
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,640
right and so we need to look to practice

536
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,080
at the time of the founding to

537
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,179
understand what the original public

538
00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:36,070
understanding of the right was now the

539
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,070
historical evidence we have uncovered

540
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,179
indicates that the time of the founding

541
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:42,610
an individual convicted of a crime was

542
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,260
only stripped of their firearm rights in

543
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,669
two instances when they were

544
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:47,559
incarcerated or when they were sentenced

545
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:49,600
to a crime punishable by death in both

546
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,429
of those instances the individual also

547
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:53,770
lost their political rights in contrast

548
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,360
in cases where the individual did not

549
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,679
lose their political rights upon

550
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:58,480
conviction they did not lose their right

551
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,250
to bear arms this indicate you're

552
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,090
showing me the

553
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,030
all those laws we've upheld denying

554
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:07,540
convicted felons the opportunity to vote

555
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,850
while they're on probation many states

556
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:14,170
have that law all of the states that had

557
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,870
lifetime voting bans those are

558
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,840
unconstitutional as well no your honor

559
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,490
we limit still haven't told me why you

560
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:25,960
haven't amendment is more fundamental

561
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,690
than those other rights it's certainly

562
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,730
not your honor the reason we conduct the

563
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,530
Second Amendment analysis in this way is

564
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,540
because Heller has instructed us to do

565
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,520
so the Second Amendment right to bear

566
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,170
arms was the codification of a

567
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:40,210
pre-existing right to bear arms that

568
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:41,500
existed under British common law

569
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,260
starting in the year 1689 and so the

570
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,760
founding generation was not developing

571
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,740
any new right they were merely codifying

572
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,960
a right that already existed that's part

573
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,490
of why the court in Heller Alfa's I'm

574
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,920
sorry I thought our Constitution was

575
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,610
creating new rights as this courts right

576
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:01,270
not to quarters soldiers was not a

577
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:05,290
British right it was codified in our

578
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:07,480
Constitution because our founding

579
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,360
fathers were upset that that was

580
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,520
happening in Britain

581
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,420
my apologies are on there that's

582
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,280
certainly right the Second Amendment

583
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,900
right was not at the creation of a new

584
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,760
right but the codification of a

585
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,950
pre-existing right to bear arms and it

586
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,450
seems at the time of the founding that

587
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,950
right was limited to members of the

588
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:26,380
political community Ian groves as far as

589
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,850
we know remains a member of the

590
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,680
political community and that's why he

591
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,240
retains his second Amendment right to

592
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,220
vote does your argument depend at all on

593
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,610
the fact that a misdemeanor that this

594
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,290
would have been a misdemeanor and this

595
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,210
would not have been a felony at the time

596
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,940
of the founding under any historical

597
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,640
understanding of his the crime that he

598
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,220
committed just do you make that argument

599
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,470
or is that not part of your argument so

600
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,820
your honor that's certainly relevant

601
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,900
that at the time of the founding

602
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,090
individuals convicted of misdemeanors

603
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,770
were not denied political rights nor

604
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,420
were they denied the right to possess a

605
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,730
firearm however even if this court

606
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,260
chooses not to look merely at the

607
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,600
historical analysis we ask this court to

608
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,400
confine the scope of the Second

609
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,350
Amendment right to the original public

610
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,760
understanding of the political community

611
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,250
and then turn and ask today who is a

612
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,840
member of the political community

613
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,549
Ian groves remained a member excuse me

614
00:24:15,549 --> 00:24:17,710
an individual like Ian groves remained a

615
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,059
member of the political community and

616
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:20,650
thus retained his right to bear arms at

617
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:22,179
the time of the founding and he does so

618
00:24:22,179 --> 00:24:24,250
today so under either analysis

619
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,779
Ian groves retains the second Amendment

620
00:24:25,779 --> 00:24:29,049
right so just does that mean that if

621
00:24:29,049 --> 00:24:31,440
your historical analysis is correct that

622
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,090
felons should be able to recover their

623
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,100
arms when they're released from prison I

624
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,799
think your brief pointed out that it was

625
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,400
only when incarcerated that they

626
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,340
surrendered that right so your honor

627
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,990
that's certainly a more difficult

628
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:49,240
question to answer what we know is that

629
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,309
at present the vast majority of states

630
00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:54,760
limit the political rights of felons at

631
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,860
at least some time I think if we look at

632
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,929
the current political landscape the best

633
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:01,390
way to describe the felons position in

634
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:04,210
the political community is contested so

635
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,919
that individual may regain their right

636
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,659
to bear arms to say so conclusively

637
00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:08,679
would require a little bit more

638
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:10,659
historical analysis do we need to look

639
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:12,610
at the political community definition in

640
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:13,929
each of the states that justice

641
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:17,080
Sotomayor was referring to as to whether

642
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,450
who when felons have rights to vote when

643
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,419
they don't so Your Honor we've put forth

644
00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:24,100
the theory that the political community

645
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,630
is determined on a national scale

646
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,190
because we're not talking about any

647
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,720
specific case excuse me

648
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,820
State Constitution here we're asking

649
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,679
about the Federal Constitution which is

650
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:34,510
at one point in time you're asking us to

651
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:37,779
look at the founding fathers but should

652
00:25:37,779 --> 00:25:41,320
we look at it in the time of the Wild

653
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,340
West should we look at it today should

654
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,590
we look at it 50 years ago how do we

655
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:51,520
decide what moment that national

656
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,789
consensus was founded so your honor

657
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:56,380
there's actually two moving parts to

658
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,169
this analysis if I may explain first is

659
00:25:59,169 --> 00:26:01,179
where we set the rule for what is the

660
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:04,419
scope of the political community now the

661
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:05,860
court in Heller tells us that we need to

662
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,940
look to the original public

663
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,740
understanding of the rule the Heller

664
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,750
Court limited its analysis through the

665
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,270
end of the 1800s and so we encourage the

666
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,590
court to do the same today

667
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,480
once the scope of the Second Amendment

668
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,610
has been set the rule has been set as

669
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,070
the political community we then turn to

670
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,530
today today who is a member of that

671
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,600
political community so we're asking this

672
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,880
court to determine the now

673
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,130
no consensus today as to who retains

674
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,110
political rights you mean it have to do

675
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:34,010
that can you win just on a straight-up

676
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:37,920
analysis that your as-applied challenges

677
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:42,750
is good for a misdemeanor and no one's

678
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,480
ever made that yet it's been held by

679
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,780
heard by our court on that point can we

680
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,180
just do we have to don't do this

681
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,790
originalist analysis in order to rule

682
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:56,670
for your client so it's true your honor

683
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,590
that no excuse me none of the lower

684
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,150
courts besides the Third Circuit in

685
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:02,040
bender up has considered a case like

686
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,050
this where the individual at issue was a

687
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:04,740
misdemeanant

688
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,210
and in the bender up case the court

689
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,760
found that the law was unconstitutional

690
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,010
as applied to that individual this Court

691
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,020
does need to answer two questions the

692
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,730
first is whether Ian groves has the

693
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,470
right and the second is whether the

694
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,630
burden on that right is justified so to

695
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:21,150
determine who has the right we ask this

696
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,590
court to look to the original public

697
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,880
understanding of the Constitution that's

698
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,820
assuming we believe he was convicted of

699
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,610
a misdemeanor generally the definition

700
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:33,300
of felon has always been someone who can

701
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,090
be jailed for over a year and under the

702
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,680
crime he committed he could have been

703
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,470
jailed for more than two years far above

704
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:44,840
the minimum that most felons are

705
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,150
announced it's only the oddities of this

706
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:52,740
state Ames a state that makes this amis

707
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:57,990
misdemeanor so why shouldn't we use the

708
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:01,170
normal understanding of felons you're

709
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,910
asking us to use the original

710
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:06,270
understanding of who's a part of the

711
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,680
political community but you're not

712
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,110
asking us to do that with respect to

713
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:12,570
who's a felon two things your honor

714
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:15,420
first if this court was operating under

715
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,280
what was the definition of a felony or

716
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,630
misdemeanor at the time of the founding

717
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,730
Ian groves his crime forgery was

718
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:21,960
considered to be a misdemeanor at the

719
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,240
time of the founding now the reason that

720
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,250
it's important to note that Ian groves

721
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,150
is a misdemeanant

722
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:29,010
is because when it comes to political

723
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,600
rights the line between felons and

724
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,520
misdemeanants is actually pretty clear

725
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,530
now the vast majority of states only

726
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:37,080
limit political rights for felons and in

727
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,700
the states that do have misdemeanors

728
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,380
punishable by more than one year

729
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,000
that includes Ames but it also includes

730
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,620
states like South Carolina and

731
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,350
Pennsylvania in those states the states

732
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,880
only limit political rights for

733
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,460
individuals classified as felons what

734
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,260
this tells us is that the classification

735
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,420
of the offense is dispositive when it

736
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,670
comes to political rights if I could ask

737
00:28:56,670 --> 00:29:00,510
in your briefs you describe mr. groves

738
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:03,270
as they never incarcerated nonviolent

739
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:06,300
misdemeanant our conversation right now

740
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,740
has been focusing on whether he's a

741
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,490
misdemeanant

742
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,980
or a felon but I wondered whether how

743
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,590
the other two aspects of his prior

744
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:16,770
convictions play into the rule that you

745
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:18,830
would propose this is an as-applied

746
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:23,870
challenge and you know you have a

747
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:27,120
persuasive argument that he poses very

748
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,610
little risk but I wondered you know we

749
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,550
have struggled in defining what is a

750
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,990
violent crime or a non-violent crime

751
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:35,850
what might be just looking at elements

752
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,950
is purse-snatching for example a violent

753
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:40,560
crime that would disqualify someone and

754
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,240
I wonder what rule you would propose

755
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,690
that we be adopting if we were to take

756
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:48,870
your general position with regard to mr.

757
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,910
groves sure your honor

758
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:53,400
so first just to clarify the reason that

759
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,260
we discussed the relative dangerousness

760
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,330
of the category of individuals never

761
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,670
incarcerated nonviolent misdemeanants is

762
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:00,810
because we didn't want to focus our

763
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:03,000
analysis specifically on mr. groves

764
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,620
because we didn't want to convey to this

765
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,300
court that we were asking for perfect

766
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,100
tailoring that's concededly not the

767
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,200
analysis here the state must only show

768
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,160
narrow tailoring

769
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,310
however we put forth that because never

770
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,260
incarcerated nonviolent misdemeanants as

771
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,570
a class pose no heightened risk of gun

772
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:20,160
violence or they certainly don't pose a

773
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,230
heightened risk for life that shows that

774
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,660
this law is not just slightly over broad

775
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,340
but that it's dramatically over broad

776
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,740
but I'm sorry what difference does it

777
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:32,370
make whether it's a felon violent or

778
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:35,660
nonviolent in your theory of this case

779
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,490
your theory of the cases we go back to

780
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:42,450
original intent and you tell us that

781
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:45,060
back then the only people who were

782
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,510
deprived of a gun were felons in jail or

783
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:51,260
people who were subject to capital death

784
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:56,540
so is your theory founded on him being a

785
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:00,660
non-violent miscreant I don't quite

786
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,640
understand what's the purpose

787
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,440
where are you asking us to draw the line

788
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,410
sure your honor so this analysis

789
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:09,690
involves a two separate questions the

790
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,100
first is whether the individual

791
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,170
possesses a right to bear arms that

792
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,340
depends on if they remember the

793
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,140
political community and so there is

794
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,850
where the classification is misdemeanor

795
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:20,490
or felony is dispositive now when we get

796
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:22,230
to the second step of the analysis so

797
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:25,140
you think three felons of any kind are

798
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:28,230
not part of the political community they

799
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:30,240
may not be your honor as I was

800
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,280
discussing with justice Carney and that

801
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,900
question is a little bit more difficult

802
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,090
to answer because the vast majority of

803
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:38,730
states 48 to be exact a strip political

804
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,710
rights from felons though many do give

805
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:42,300
these political rights back so it's a

806
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,680
little bit more difficult of a question

807
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,360
to answer than in the case of an

808
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,280
individual classified as a misdemeanant

809
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,290
the vast majority of states do not strip

810
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:50,520
any political rights from these

811
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,640
individuals but there's two questions

812
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,110
before this court and I'd like to make

813
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,150
that clear the first is the historical

814
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,950
question which answers whether Ian Gross

815
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,840
has a second Amendment right but the

816
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,250
second is the question of whether the

817
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,750
burden imposed by that right is

818
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:07,650
justified now to begin because this law

819
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:10,050
is a permanent deprivation of the right

820
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:12,210
to bear arms we argue that it should be

821
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,970
held to be per se unconstitutional but

822
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,290
even if this court were to proceed

823
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:18,420
through a scrutiny analysis the law

824
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,460
still can't pass scrutiny because the

825
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,410
state has failed to put forth sufficient

826
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:24,840
evidence to indicate that this that

827
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,520
excuse me that depriving an individual

828
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,590
like Ian groves is necessary in any way

829
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,690
to prevent gun violence now the state

830
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,490
relies on two studies to come to its

831
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,500
conclusion but we urge his court not to

832
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,120
rely on those two studies too heavily

833
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,310
that's because these studies focus their

834
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,530
analysis mainly on prisoners within the

835
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,630
first few years of their convictions but

836
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,550
in contrast Ian groves was never

837
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,320
sentenced to incarceration and his crime

838
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,570
was over 15 years ago so those groups

839
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:51,210
are just too different and even if in

840
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:53,130
the abstract it were reasonable for the

841
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:54,990
court to come to excuse me for the state

842
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,670
to come to the conclusion that it did in

843
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,290
light of the evidence that we've put

844
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:00,030
forth that suggests an individual like

845
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,980
Ian groves never poses an increase

846
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,180
excuse me

847
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,300
never poses an increase

848
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,950
risk of violence or certainly doesn't

849
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,720
after a term of seven to ten years we

850
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,640
argued that the state's conclusion is

851
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,350
just not a reasonable conclusion drawed

852
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,330
from such so what a reasonable time

853
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:18,250
limit to bar him under your theory here

854
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,020
you make a great deal of the fact that

855
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:23,320
it was a non-violent conviction and he

856
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,420
has not been a reservist for fifteen

857
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,390
years says five enough it's chann enough

858
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:32,680
is what's enough so based on the

859
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,920
consensus of recent social science it

860
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,840
seems to be that after a period of ten

861
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,270
years the relative risk of an offender a

862
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:42,550
non-violent offender decreases to the

863
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,470
point that it meets the relative risk of

864
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,270
a non offender and essentially the

865
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,400
individual poses no risk at all now this

866
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,640
is this is also we can also find support

867
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,500
for this in the practices of the US

868
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,300
Sentencing Commission which holds that

869
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,520
after ten years an individual's prior

870
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,230
conviction should not be considered in

871
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,420
calculating a criminal history so are

872
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:04,030
you asking us to use a ten year period

873
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:06,940
to bar misdemeanors and people who

874
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,550
commit misdemeanors from having firearms

875
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,380
is that your is that what you're

876
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,929
advocating here today at the very least

877
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:15,790
your honor we also put forth evidence I

878
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:17,230
thought you said it was per se

879
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:21,150
unconstitutional yes your so which is it

880
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,980
your honor a lifetime permanent and

881
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,960
complete deprivation of the fundamental

882
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,550
right to bear arms is per se

883
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:30,280
unconstitutional a firearms restriction

884
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,380
that is limited in time or limited in

885
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,810
scope in some way may be constitutional

886
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:36,550
if the state can show that it is

887
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,620
justified now it's our contention that

888
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,570
an individual like Ian groves never

889
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,130
posed a heightened risk of gun violence

890
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:44,440
and so if I love showing does the state

891
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,440
have to make so your honor that depends

892
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,060
on the level of scrutiny that this court

893
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,280
chooses to analyze this law under we get

894
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,929
districts if we're strict scrutiny

895
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:55,000
because we're out of her save and what

896
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,670
level of showing so what the state needs

897
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,110
to show is that it was a reasonable

898
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,390
inference based on substantial evidence

899
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,400
the problem with the state's evidence is

900
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,960
that there's simply not enough for there

901
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,550
to be under any definition of the term

902
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,710
substantial evidence to indicate an

903
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,090
individual like Ian groves

904
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,070
poses a heightened risk that's why the

905
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:14,290
state can't succeed under either strict

906
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:17,200
or intermediate scrutiny but I like it's

907
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:17,680
not

908
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,710
that people who have not been recidivist

909
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:26,380
for 15 years that all of them fail to

910
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,750
commit a crime it's just that the

911
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:32,740
numbers are small so why should we upset

912
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,770
the state's judgment that even a small

913
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:40,589
number of potential recidivist is enough

914
00:35:40,589 --> 00:35:44,950
to justify a lifetime ban because your

915
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,540
honor the second Amendment right to bear

916
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,099
arms as this Court has said is a

917
00:35:48,099 --> 00:35:50,980
fundamental right and and no amount of

918
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,410
justification put forth by the state can

919
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:55,210
justify the total stripping of that

920
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:56,920
fundamental right that's why we ask that

921
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:06,210
this court reverse thank you respondents

922
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:15,209
thank you madam Chief Justice and may it

923
00:36:15,209 --> 00:36:17,459
please the court my name is Marlon

924
00:36:17,459 --> 00:36:19,140
golden and I represent the state of Ames

925
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,420
I will show that the Ames felon in

926
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,009
possession law does not offend the

927
00:36:23,009 --> 00:36:23,789
Second Amendment

928
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:26,549
my co-counsel Nick Carr will show the 3d

929
00:36:26,549 --> 00:36:28,619
printed gun violence prevention act does

930
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:30,930
not violate the First Amendment we ask

931
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:33,779
the court to affirm on both counts the

932
00:36:33,779 --> 00:36:35,489
right to bear arms does not extend a

933
00:36:35,489 --> 00:36:37,619
person's our society has long thought

934
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:39,690
too dangerous to carry lethal weapons

935
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,819
when he committed his crimes

936
00:36:41,819 --> 00:36:43,440
petitioner forfeited the Second

937
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,019
Amendment guarantee and even if the

938
00:36:46,019 --> 00:36:47,609
Second Amendment protects a right to

939
00:36:47,609 --> 00:36:50,190
bear arms the petitioner enjoys he has

940
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,509
not shown that the law as

941
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:53,969
unconstitutional as applied to him at

942
00:36:53,969 --> 00:36:55,799
the founding would have been found too

943
00:36:55,799 --> 00:36:58,650
dangerous we believe so justice Elrod

944
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,289
under what theory he would be considered

945
00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:03,180
an unvirtuous citizen at the founding

946
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,259
your honor because he would have

947
00:37:04,259 --> 00:37:06,900
committed crimes that represent severe

948
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,880
maladjustment and disrespect for the law

949
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,049
forgery would have been considered it

950
00:37:13,049 --> 00:37:15,390
would have stripped him is under the

951
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,769
founding you have some authority for

952
00:37:16,769 --> 00:37:19,559
that just justice or odd that's correct

953
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:22,109
we believe that the founding level

954
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:24,749
sources show that the number of felonies

955
00:37:24,749 --> 00:37:27,509
even before the felonies had made their

956
00:37:27,509 --> 00:37:29,400
way from English common law to the

957
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,009
United States had already balloon so we

958
00:37:32,009 --> 00:37:34,529
have information that shows that even

959
00:37:34,529 --> 00:37:36,539
Blackstone and his commentaries in law

960
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:37,949
of England said that there were at least

961
00:37:37,949 --> 00:37:40,380
160 felonies at that time we believe I

962
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,789
think thought your adversary said that

963
00:37:43,789 --> 00:37:46,440
forgery was a misdemeanor at the

964
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,319
founding well chief justice Sotomayor

965
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:51,329
even if that were so that does not

966
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:53,339
resolve this case the traditional

967
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:55,259
definition of a felony is someone who is

968
00:37:55,259 --> 00:37:57,299
punishable by a year imprisonment or

969
00:37:57,299 --> 00:37:59,819
more and which we look to the tradition

970
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,529
that the understanding at the founding

971
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,259
she's arguing founding what do you

972
00:38:04,259 --> 00:38:06,449
arguing we argue that we argue that the

973
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:09,420
traditional restrictions on felons that

974
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,009
is those who are punishable by at least

975
00:38:11,009 --> 00:38:13,349
a year in prison or what just additional

976
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:16,529
since when what we believe at Lisa's

977
00:38:16,529 --> 00:38:17,969
traditional as this court noted in

978
00:38:17,969 --> 00:38:18,479
Heller

979
00:38:18,479 --> 00:38:20,670
so in Heller this court said that

980
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:23,430
long-standing prohibitions not founding

981
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:24,869
era Probus so you talk about the

982
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:25,730
nineteen there

983
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:28,490
is that what you're talking about at

984
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:30,290
least dating back to the interwar period

985
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:32,450
justice Elrod but we believe history is

986
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:34,690
instructive here as well for example the

987
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:37,670
Pennsylvania Minority Report the dissent

988
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:39,110
of minority at this Pennsylvania State

989
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,420
ratification convention showed that the

990
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,520
right to bear arms could be restricted

991
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,010
for crimes committed or for risk of

992
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:48,080
public and injury and we believe that

993
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,270
understanding is what's informative here

994
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:52,640
today so it's true that the authors of

995
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,250
one state what other documents can you

996
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,190
point to to show us how other states

997
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:00,920
responded Chief Justice Emily or that

998
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,990
was one state it was shared however by

999
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:05,720
the drafters in Massachusetts in New

1000
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,790
Hampshire all of those states were

1001
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:09,950
penned by anti-federalists who

1002
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,300
eventually want out with the

1003
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,560
ratification of the Bill of Rights

1004
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,020
itself so it's their understanding of

1005
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,820
the Second Amendment that the right is

1006
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,100
not unlimited that Heller identified it

1007
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,040
said that the scope of the right did not

1008
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,720
extend to those long-standing

1009
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,510
prohibitions that were understood to be

1010
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:28,400
outside the scope of the right entirely

1011
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,500
now Heller tells us that these are

1012
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,570
exceptions to the Second Amendment right

1013
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:35,240
well Hilary knowledge is a presumption

1014
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,940
but doesn't really articulate at any

1015
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:41,380
great length um as for felonies and for

1016
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,430
people with mental illness and

1017
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,750
acknowledges that the list is not

1018
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,120
exhaustive but it also recognizes a

1019
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,520
fundamental right to bear arms which

1020
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,290
hadn't been articulated in that way

1021
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:53,500
before and I wonder how the state can

1022
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,690
justify under intermediate scrutiny say

1023
00:39:56,690 --> 00:40:01,640
a lifetime ban where the right is seen

1024
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,490
as necessary to for people to defend

1025
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:07,820
themselves why should someone who has

1026
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,970
been convicted of such a an offense as

1027
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:14,410
this that didn't even merit jail time he

1028
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:16,370
deprived of the right to defend his

1029
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:18,680
family well justice Carney all I'll take

1030
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,810
your question about the presumptively

1031
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:22,640
lawful and the scope of the right first

1032
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,520
which is if you read the opinion in the

1033
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,870
Heller delivered the court in Heller

1034
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:28,460
delivered and its entirety it showed

1035
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,320
that everything hinged on the fact that

1036
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,570
petitioner in that case dick Heller was

1037
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:34,460
not disqualified from the exercise of

1038
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,810
second Amendment rights in the first

1039
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,850
place the court also grouped this

1040
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:39,069
discussion of the long stain

1041
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:41,799
prohibitions alongside its decision in

1042
00:40:41,799 --> 00:40:43,719
United States versus Miller and that

1043
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:45,459
dates back to the 1930s where it said

1044
00:40:45,459 --> 00:40:47,469
that sawed-off shotguns were

1045
00:40:47,469 --> 00:40:49,900
presumptively categorically outside the

1046
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,719
Second Amendment right and so even if we

1047
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:54,640
believe that the presumptively lawful

1048
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,799
language refers to a rebuttable

1049
00:40:56,799 --> 00:40:58,180
presumption which of course the state

1050
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:01,539
contests we believe that the burden that

1051
00:41:01,539 --> 00:41:03,579
the petitioner in this case would have

1052
00:41:03,579 --> 00:41:06,880
to show is that he is in some meaningful

1053
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,279
way different from the historically

1054
00:41:09,279 --> 00:41:11,799
barred class and he's failed to carry

1055
00:41:11,799 --> 00:41:13,749
that burden well let me follow up in

1056
00:41:13,749 --> 00:41:15,069
just a second you said presumptively

1057
00:41:15,069 --> 00:41:17,349
Roth lawful doesn't mean that it's a

1058
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,509
rebuttable presumption I mean the state

1059
00:41:19,509 --> 00:41:22,089
can take whatever measures it wants with

1060
00:41:22,089 --> 00:41:24,069
regard to felons and denying them right

1061
00:41:24,069 --> 00:41:26,410
and there there's no examination that is

1062
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:29,109
appropriate justice Carney that's

1063
00:41:29,109 --> 00:41:32,140
correct when a felon commits his crimes

1064
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,599
and is punishable by a sentence of up to

1065
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:37,749
five years in prison in this case he has

1066
00:41:37,749 --> 00:41:39,640
forfeited his rights toothless's

1067
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,309
guarantee is right to bear arms to vote

1068
00:41:42,309 --> 00:41:44,650
to serve on a jury to seek public office

1069
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:46,900
this Court has noted as much in its

1070
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,400
decisions such as Richardson versus

1071
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,349
Ramirez and we do not believe that the

1072
00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:52,569
Second Amendment right stands in any way

1073
00:41:52,569 --> 00:41:55,539
in contrast to those rights which as a

1074
00:41:55,539 --> 00:41:57,699
matter of legislative grace the states

1075
00:41:57,699 --> 00:42:00,039
do often permit as the petitioner in

1076
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:01,900
this case argues but that is not the

1077
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,799
same as a constitutional requirement so

1078
00:42:04,799 --> 00:42:07,420
what do you do with the cases that we

1079
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:10,809
have to deal with people sexual

1080
00:42:10,809 --> 00:42:12,999
predators for example and they're barred

1081
00:42:12,999 --> 00:42:15,219
for a time period from their computers

1082
00:42:15,219 --> 00:42:16,779
but there have been cases discussing

1083
00:42:16,779 --> 00:42:19,479
that they cannot be barred forever from

1084
00:42:19,479 --> 00:42:23,469
having access to a computer why why is

1085
00:42:23,469 --> 00:42:26,859
that situation different well justice or

1086
00:42:26,859 --> 00:42:29,440
I'd I would first note that again we

1087
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,660
believe that felons categorically

1088
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,849
forfeit their right to bear arms so long

1089
00:42:33,849 --> 00:42:36,130
as they remain a felon so Heller

1090
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:37,989
referred to felons in the mentally ill

1091
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:40,599
in the present tense and this tells us

1092
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,309
something important which is that so

1093
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,529
long as someone remains a felon the

1094
00:42:44,529 --> 00:42:45,880
state has not violated any

1095
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,859
constitutional right when it with holds

1096
00:42:47,859 --> 00:42:49,749
from him the right to possess a firearm

1097
00:42:49,749 --> 00:42:52,000
now when that status changed

1098
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,359
if a state continued to bar someone from

1099
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,970
continuing to own a firearm we believe

1100
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:00,280
that we might have a closer case what

1101
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:03,880
I'm sorry I'm a little confused how do

1102
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,810
you not become a felon are you taking

1103
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:10,240
their position that well you're under a

1104
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,910
criminal sentence you're a felon but

1105
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:15,820
once you leave a federal sentence you no

1106
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:19,050
longer are this man served his time on

1107
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:22,869
probation and he's been incident free

1108
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:24,910
for 15 years I'm not quite sure what you

1109
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:25,330
mean

1110
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:28,030
stop being a felon she certainly should

1111
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:29,740
justice Sotomayor what we mean is that

1112
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,720
someone would have to have either their

1113
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,210
rights restored the record expunged or

1114
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:36,970
would have to receive a pardon and the

1115
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:39,160
statute that aims is adopted of course

1116
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,350
references federal law provides that

1117
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:44,230
someone even with those conditions might

1118
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:46,359
have is an explicit restriction imposed

1119
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:49,660
upon them upon expungement or pardoned

1120
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,250
that they still are not able to possess

1121
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:53,170
a firearm and we believe a rights

1122
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:56,400
restored that's a civil rights restored

1123
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,630
we believe that's probably what that

1124
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:02,710
means yes and so are you taking the

1125
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:05,410
position that the petitioner in this

1126
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:07,140
case didn't have his rights restored

1127
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,670
well the record is civil rights restored

1128
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:12,250
the record is silent on that she's best

1129
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,290
I said in my or but we if we even if we

1130
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:16,300
assume that his rights have been

1131
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,910
restored in this case the political

1132
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:20,200
community argument petitioner has

1133
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,869
identified simply does not resolve felon

1134
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:25,900
and possession challenges if it did it

1135
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,880
would mean that states that allow

1136
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,160
currently incarcerated persons to vote

1137
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,500
such as Maine and Vermont would stand in

1138
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,330
violation of the Second Amendment when

1139
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:35,980
they prevented that person from

1140
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:39,730
exercising a right to bear arms if

1141
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:42,760
you're wrong about that it's a felony

1142
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,760
and that it's truly a misdemeanor assume

1143
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,520
arguendo it's a misdemeanor do you can

1144
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:52,390
you still win we can Justice elrod no

1145
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:55,300
okay can you give any example

1146
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,370
demeanor violation suspends a

1147
00:44:57,370 --> 00:45:00,040
constitutional right forever well

1148
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,420
justice eller I would believe this is a

1149
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:03,460
situation analogous to the sixth

1150
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:05,650
amendment context so the court has said

1151
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:08,110
in Lewis that certain misdemeanors are

1152
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:10,090
serious enough to trigger the jury trial

1153
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:12,430
right other misdemeanors are mere petty

1154
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:14,920
offenses it has chosen an objective

1155
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,870
indicator of seriousness in those cases

1156
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:18,970
and it is looked to the maximum

1157
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:21,610
punishable sentence we ask the court to

1158
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:24,070
follow a similar path here certain

1159
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:26,350
misdemeanor crimes are so grave that

1160
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:29,110
they are functionally felonies and the

1161
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:31,420
states have long understood that they do

1162
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,490
not offend the Second Amendment when

1163
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:35,230
they prevent people who have committed

1164
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:37,660
those crimes from owning a gun because

1165
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,970
they are more likely to abuse a firearm

1166
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:43,270
as a fact of their criminal record now

1167
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:45,370
this accords with long-standing

1168
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:48,040
understandings of what state

1169
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,740
legislatures and what Congress can do

1170
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:53,710
and analyzing the types of people who

1171
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,450
are more likely to commit gun violence

1172
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:57,310
in the future the court said in Heller

1173
00:45:57,310 --> 00:45:59,920
that certain policy choices were taken

1174
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,200
off the table it also said at the

1175
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,270
conclusion of its opinion that this did

1176
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:06,310
not leave the states powerless to combat

1177
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:07,660
the problem of gun violence in this

1178
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:10,120
country and so felon in possession laws

1179
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:12,130
like the one that Ames has enacted is

1180
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:15,130
valid policy choice exercised by the

1181
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:17,530
states and all of its applications so

1182
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:19,750
you're using it as a use in the status

1183
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:22,810
of felon as a proxy for dangerousness

1184
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:25,570
and yet not taking into account the

1185
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:27,490
lapse of time the non violent nature of

1186
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:29,590
the offense the fact that no time was

1187
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:32,200
served and or in no time was included in

1188
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,640
the sentence it seems like a very

1189
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:39,010
imperfect match doesn't the state have

1190
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:41,040
an obligation in light of the

1191
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,510
fundamental fundamental nature of the

1192
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:46,090
right to do better tailoring well

1193
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:47,890
justice Carney of two answers there

1194
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:50,590
first is that the unvirtuous citizen

1195
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:53,650
rationale that has long animated gun

1196
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:56,710
safety laws is not limited to a showing

1197
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:58,360
of future dangerousness now if it were

1198
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:02,110
so the statute in this case 922 G would

1199
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:03,880
not include people like those who've

1200
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,740
renounce their citizenship for example

1201
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,590
so second if we assume how

1202
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:10,120
for that the showing of future

1203
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:13,120
dangerousness is what justifies Ames's

1204
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,800
felon in possession law and nothing else

1205
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,980
then the state can succeed if it burdens

1206
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,600
a right petitioner enjoys under

1207
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,250
intermediate scrutiny but aren't you

1208
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:23,590
using the status of being a felon as a

1209
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,240
proxy for dangerousness I thought that's

1210
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,760
what I was just hearing you argue we do

1211
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,170
believe that there's significant

1212
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:31,390
correlation there Justice Carney we

1213
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,610
believe that the legislators do not err

1214
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:35,380
when they believe that those who

1215
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,660
committed crimes in the past and have a

1216
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:39,760
track record for violating the law are

1217
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,310
more likely to violate the law in the

1218
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:44,290
future and do so in a way that offends

1219
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:47,200
public safety and community security and

1220
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,180
so as applied to mr. groves who

1221
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:52,900
committed a misdemeanor of forging a an

1222
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:56,830
ID 17 years ago and has been law abiding

1223
00:47:56,830 --> 00:47:58,690
since then I think your adversary would

1224
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:02,170
say that doesn't predict violence of any

1225
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:05,230
type how can you can test that well we

1226
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:06,640
disagreed there your honor and the

1227
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,160
reason that we disagree is because the

1228
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,990
court would have to require a more

1229
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:13,240
exacting standard in order to struck

1230
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,400
strike down the state's law it does not

1231
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,440
need to show that as applied to an

1232
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,210
individual person who is a state law

1233
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:21,430
misdemeanor that the law passes

1234
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:23,410
intermediate scrutiny rather it only

1235
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:26,260
needs to show that the law is valid as

1236
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:28,630
applied to that class of persons that

1237
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:30,910
the state reasonably believes posed a

1238
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:33,570
future increased risk of harm to others

1239
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:37,720
is it only to gun regulation of felons

1240
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:41,440
that we apply intermediate scrutiny or

1241
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,230
is it your position that all regulation

1242
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:46,510
of firearms is subject to strict

1243
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:50,110
scrutiny chief justice Sotomayor of

1244
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:53,440
course there are only a handful of cases

1245
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,900
dealing with the Second Amendment

1246
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,220
explicitly at the Supreme Court now the

1247
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:59,050
courts of appeals have applied

1248
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:01,150
intermediate scrutiny to any number of

1249
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:03,400
restrictions on the right to bear arms

1250
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,250
we only however proceed to strict

1251
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:09,430
scrutiny if the right that is restricted

1252
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:12,640
by the law is at the core of the Second

1253
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,130
Amendment right now felons as a class

1254
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:17,860
can never sit at the core of the second

1255
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:18,880
Amendment right because they have

1256
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,500
forfeited the right to bear arms

1257
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,700
entirely

1258
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,860
second even if we assume that

1259
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:26,440
presumptively lawful means that we have

1260
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,360
a rebuttable presumption here that

1261
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,710
language in the court's opinion in

1262
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:31,600
Heller must be given some weight and it

1263
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,070
can't be squared with strict scrutiny

1264
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:36,670
but usually means something can actually

1265
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:40,300
but it so what in your judgment would

1266
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:43,540
that be well chief justice Sotomayor the

1267
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:44,920
rebuttable presumption if as-applied

1268
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,840
challenges are allowed would come in

1269
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,090
those close cases where we're unsure

1270
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:51,880
whether someone can validly still be

1271
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,820
considered a felon so for example in the

1272
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:57,010
only Circuit Court of Appeals to ever

1273
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:59,860
uphold a as-applied challenge to an

1274
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:02,620
individual felon the person and the

1275
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:03,970
challengers in that case had already

1276
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:06,970
seat received relief under state law in

1277
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:09,400
state court but nevertheless was still

1278
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,740
subject to the federal prohibition so we

1279
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:13,390
can imagine the opposite being true as

1280
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:16,060
well now we can also imagine cases where

1281
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:19,060
someone has received their civil rights

1282
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:21,520
restored or received a pardon had the

1283
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,260
record expunged by a court but

1284
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:25,210
nevertheless under the statute is still

1285
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:27,280
prohibited from owning a firearm and

1286
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,740
while we still believe that law likely

1287
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:31,180
could pass for name we believe that

1288
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,980
would be a closer case and that would be

1289
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:34,660
the kind of as-applied challenge the

1290
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,100
court would accept because it would be

1291
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,710
answering a key question is this person

1292
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:39,850
still a felon

1293
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:43,000
in this case there's no doubt petitioner

1294
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,820
status has not changed and if and until

1295
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:48,460
that changes the state of aims does not

1296
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:50,110
stand in violation of the Second

1297
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:51,910
Amendment and enforcing its felon in

1298
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:55,210
possession law against several now some

1299
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:58,780
have some have criticized this approach

1300
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:00,490
that you're discussing this intermediate

1301
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:02,710
approach is treating the Second

1302
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:06,370
Amendment as a second class right would

1303
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:09,550
you agree that a publisher who was

1304
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:13,090
convicted of a misdemeanor could not

1305
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:16,270
have his publication rights suspended

1306
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:18,450
for the rest of his life

1307
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,710
justice aura we have we have two answers

1308
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,990
there first is that we don't advise

1309
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:24,940
intermediate scrutiny I'm not the first

1310
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:28,930
person to ask that question certainly we

1311
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:30,580
don't believe intermediate scrutiny is

1312
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:32,710
necessary here we believe that text

1313
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:34,829
history and tradition of the sex

1314
00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:37,050
definitively resolve this question

1315
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:39,849
felons categorically lie outside the

1316
00:51:39,849 --> 00:51:42,250
scope of the Second Amendment now to

1317
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:43,690
answer your question about the publisher

1318
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:46,240
in the First Amendment question I would

1319
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,359
need to say that the rights proceed from

1320
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,760
different historical rationales so

1321
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,880
whereas someone who is prohibited from

1322
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,609
engaging in the marketplace of ideas has

1323
00:51:57,609 --> 00:52:00,040
had a disability worked upon him to

1324
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,480
engage in the fundamental right of

1325
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,599
freedom of expression someone who is

1326
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:07,930
violated by a statute that prohibits

1327
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:10,450
someone when he belongs to a class that

1328
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:12,880
is shown to be more dangerous that is a

1329
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,680
simple exercise of the state police

1330
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,930
power it is justified not as a punitive

1331
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:19,810
measure against him but by a exercise of

1332
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:22,329
the state's ability to protect public

1333
00:52:22,329 --> 00:52:24,339
safety so you're saying we are supposed

1334
00:52:24,339 --> 00:52:25,690
to treat the first and second

1335
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:27,819
differently is that what you're saying

1336
00:52:27,819 --> 00:52:30,280
just justice Elrod we believe that the

1337
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,589
Second Amendment guarantee is just as

1338
00:52:32,589 --> 00:52:34,390
fundamental as the first we only say

1339
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:37,300
that different purposes animate a felon

1340
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:39,970
in possession law as opposed to those

1341
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:43,510
that would hypo was a misdemeanor even a

1342
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:45,609
state law misdemeanor that might be

1343
00:52:45,609 --> 00:52:48,280
subject to a traditional felon in

1344
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,260
possession law because of the virtue of

1345
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:51,460
the number of years that he can be

1346
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:54,460
placed in a term of years in prison so

1347
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:57,400
if we understand that the long-standing

1348
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,920
tradition of felon in possession laws

1349
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,470
that this court said was lawful in

1350
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:05,500
Heller remains just as lawful today the

1351
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,210
only reason that the court could find

1352
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:09,760
for the petitioner is if he was able to

1353
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,010
distinguish himself from the mine-run of

1354
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:13,569
cases that challenged felon in

1355
00:53:13,569 --> 00:53:15,460
possession laws in this country year in

1356
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,650
and year out and that is a burden that

1357
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:19,180
petitioner has failed to carry in this

1358
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:26,290
case even the best typos you could make

1359
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:30,430
on that what's he missing justice Elrod

1360
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:32,560
what's missing is a change in his status

1361
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:35,640
as a felon other than him not being

1362
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,470
convicted is that that's the only thing

1363
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:41,020
missing and we believe that that is the

1364
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:42,880
key thing that is absent from this case

1365
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,040
justice Elrod if there are no further

1366
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,650
questions we ask the court to affirm

1367
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:58,990
thank you thank you thank you madam

1368
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:00,280
Chief Justice and may it please the

1369
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:00,730
court

1370
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:02,680
my name is Nick akar and today I will

1371
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:05,290
argue that the aims 3d printed gun

1372
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:06,550
violence prevention Act is

1373
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:07,770
constitutional

1374
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:10,900
your honors today technology enables

1375
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:13,420
individuals to 3d print guns in the

1376
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,880
comfort of their own home publishing

1377
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,400
these files offers individuals a new

1378
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,900
form of gun distribution that

1379
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,150
circumvents both state and federal gun

1380
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:24,400
safety we don't permit the banning of

1381
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:29,190
books but teach people how to make bombs

1382
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:31,540
the books don't provide the raw

1383
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:34,510
materials they don't provide the

1384
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:38,320
instruments to make the bombs so they're

1385
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,180
not much different than my mind the

1386
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:46,060
diagrams so why is the fact that a CAD

1387
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:50,140
diagram capable of being put into effect

1388
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:52,150
by someone else any different than a

1389
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:54,580
bomb-making book Your Honor we would

1390
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:56,620
argue that these 3d printable gun files

1391
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:59,530
those are regulated by the GV PA the Gun

1392
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:01,630
Violence Prevention Act and aims are not

1393
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:04,210
simple blueprints they are not the

1394
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:06,070
blueprint that tells an individual how

1395
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:06,820
to make a gun

1396
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:08,830
they're the blueprint that actually

1397
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:11,710
makes the gun this is a form of

1398
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:14,050
technology that this court or any court

1399
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:15,730
for that matter has ever countenance

1400
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:18,430
it's a technology that can build an

1401
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:21,070
object and it's in that way it's

1402
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:23,200
important to understand exactly what the

1403
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,810
GV PA regulates you see the axe plain

1404
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:28,420
language limits its scope to a subset of

1405
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:31,120
CAD files or computer code those that

1406
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,430
can automatically print an operational

1407
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:35,830
gun in other words your honors the GV PA

1408
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:38,830
does not regulate firearm design files

1409
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:42,010
or CAD files that simply depict virtual

1410
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:44,710
guns it only applies to those that can

1411
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:47,380
automatically create and produce an

1412
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:49,240
operational firearm those that are ready

1413
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:52,150
ensure that sounds nice but as I

1414
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:56,110
understand it it can't you just don't

1415
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:59,460
take of CAD

1416
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:02,760
script put it into the computer and the

1417
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:06,360
gun comes out of the computer as I

1418
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:10,110
understand it you have to adjust the

1419
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:13,080
program to a particular preacher you

1420
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,330
have to change the printing mechanism to

1421
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:18,360
do the slices and then you have to

1422
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:21,270
provide the raw materials and all sorts

1423
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:23,580
of other steps have to be taken before

1424
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:26,010
the gun produces it doesn't come out of

1425
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:28,740
the cat wholesale Your Honor we would

1426
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,150
disagree with that description of the

1427
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:33,450
technology it is true that individuals

1428
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:35,070
might have to put the puzzle pieces of

1429
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:36,510
the gun together or purchase the raw

1430
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:39,960
materials but it is not true that CAD

1431
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,570
files with ready instructions encoded

1432
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:44,610
within them can be published on the

1433
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,740
internet those files are available and

1434
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:49,080
in fact a domestic abuser names just two

1435
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,210
years ago downloaded one of these files

1436
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:53,040
and there's no evidence in the record to

1437
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,750
suggest that there was any slicing

1438
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:57,330
needed and in fact well he only as I

1439
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:02,340
understood it used a CAD part in a

1440
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:05,240
completed gun he didn't use the whole

1441
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,190
certainly Your Honor I it is possible

1442
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:10,440
for these CAD files to print parts but

1443
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,600
the contention here as chief justice

1444
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,160
sotomayor you mentioned is that the

1445
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:17,310
files are require a number of steps and

1446
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:18,690
we would disagree with that contention

1447
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:21,000
while they do require some steps there

1448
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,330
are CAD files that unlike firearm design

1449
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:25,980
files which do not have instructions to

1450
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,380
a 3d printer there are files that do

1451
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:30,060
have instructions to a 3d printer and

1452
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:32,850
would enable a young child or a domestic

1453
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:35,670
user or a felon to very easily print

1454
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:37,770
their very own gun in the comfort of

1455
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:39,240
their own home it still isn't this is a

1456
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,610
content-based restriction this is saying

1457
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:43,620
you cannot publish to the Internet

1458
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:45,350
upload files that provide information

1459
00:57:45,350 --> 00:57:48,990
that can be accessed and read and

1460
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:51,690
understood by a user albeit with a

1461
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:54,540
functional aspect to it but we don't

1462
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:56,330
like content-based restrictions

1463
00:57:56,330 --> 00:57:58,830
generally you have to satisfy strict

1464
00:57:58,830 --> 00:58:02,130
scrutiny and you know the record

1465
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:06,290
suggested that such files and

1466
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:09,540
alternative CAD programs and related

1467
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:11,340
programs have been available for quite a

1468
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:11,950
while

1469
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:15,170
that Ames is the only jurisdiction that

1470
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:16,940
is banning their uploading to the

1471
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:20,510
Internet and what I need you to explain

1472
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:21,980
to me why the state is a compelling

1473
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:24,279
interest that is narrowly tailored in

1474
00:58:24,279 --> 00:58:26,900
restricting the transfer of this

1475
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:28,940
information in the way that the statute

1476
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:31,339
does certainly your honor I'll adjust

1477
00:58:31,339 --> 00:58:33,410
the first part of your question noting

1478
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:34,609
that this might be a content-based

1479
00:58:34,609 --> 00:58:36,079
regulation and we would reject that

1480
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:38,420
contention under read a content-based

1481
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:40,190
regulation is content-based if it

1482
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:42,319
regulates based off of the idea or the

1483
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:44,270
message expressed and that's not what

1484
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:47,029
the GV PA does here the gvp a regulation

1485
00:58:47,029 --> 00:58:53,839
says don't don't upload a diagram of a

1486
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:58,730
gun how is that not an idea well your

1487
00:58:58,730 --> 00:58:59,869
honor under the plain text of the

1488
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:02,180
statute the statute does not say that an

1489
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:04,160
individual cannot upload a diagram of

1490
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,529
the gun of a gun it simply indicates

1491
00:59:06,529 --> 00:59:08,779
that an individual cannot upload onto

1492
00:59:08,779 --> 00:59:11,270
the internet available to the public a

1493
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:13,940
diagram of a gun that can automatically

1494
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:16,039
produce a firearm a diagram that has

1495
00:59:16,039 --> 00:59:18,349
instructions that would enable somebody

1496
00:59:18,349 --> 00:59:20,119
to automatically print a firearm that

1497
00:59:20,119 --> 00:59:22,069
functional component is vitally

1498
00:59:22,069 --> 00:59:23,779
important to the narrow tailoring of the

1499
00:59:23,779 --> 00:59:26,450
GV PA to justice karna justice karna to

1500
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:28,819
your point and in that way it's

1501
00:59:28,819 --> 00:59:31,400
important also to recognize that in

1502
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,260
contradiction of petitioners statement

1503
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:35,750
Ames is not the only state to have

1504
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:37,960
prohibited the publishing of these files

1505
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,400
New Jersey recently prohibited the

1506
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,410
publishing of these 3d printable gun

1507
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:44,930
files and for that matter over the past

1508
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:47,839
five years the publishing of these files

1509
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:50,119
has actually been illegal under a

1510
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:51,950
nationwide injunction presented in the

1511
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:53,900
defense distributed cases that has only

1512
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:56,480
become illegal in August furthermore

1513
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,380
since those files have been allowed to

1514
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:03,079
be uploaded legally after the Trump

1515
01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:05,299
administration has allowed for them to

1516
01:00:05,299 --> 01:00:08,240
be uploaded over 20 states including

1517
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,579
California Washington North Carolina and

1518
01:00:10,579 --> 01:00:12,589
a number a number of others who

1519
01:00:12,589 --> 01:00:14,359
understand that the uploading of these

1520
01:00:14,359 --> 01:00:17,180
3d printable gun files poses a threat to

1521
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:21,410
both public safety and got any - are you

1522
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:22,520
agreeing though that we have a

1523
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:25,020
content-based restriction on speed

1524
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:28,050
no your honor why not we don't believe

1525
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:29,250
this is a content-based restriction

1526
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:32,370
because it it regulates based off of the

1527
01:00:32,370 --> 01:00:34,590
functionality of the file but but what

1528
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:37,740
the statute says is you may not publish

1529
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:40,110
over the internet digital instructions

1530
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:42,420
in the form of CAD files or other

1531
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:45,570
computer code code is communication

1532
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:48,570
files or communication digital

1533
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:50,970
instructions are communication and it's

1534
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:53,610
a particular kind of instruction or

1535
01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:55,500
communication that is regulated here I

1536
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,030
don't understand why that is in a

1537
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:59,310
content-based restriction as to which we

1538
01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:01,830
apply strict scrutiny well your honor in

1539
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:03,570
the first instance we'd argue that this

1540
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:05,880
speech if it is to be categorized as

1541
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,950
speech by this Court should actually be

1542
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:09,570
unprotected by the First Amendment

1543
01:01:09,570 --> 01:01:11,400
because it is integral to criminal

1544
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,260
conduct under this course jurisprudence

1545
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:14,940
in Gibbon II and thus the content-based

1546
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:17,280
angry need not even come up I'm sorry

1547
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:21,300
what's intricate there is no unless

1548
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:23,670
there's a law and aims that you can't

1549
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:27,060
possess a firearm in your home what's

1550
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:32,730
illegal about having a CAD created gun

1551
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:36,090
in your home your honor under Section

1552
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:38,580
922 D of the Federal firearm statute

1553
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:40,770
there's a restriction on the

1554
01:01:40,770 --> 01:01:43,050
indiscriminate distribution of guns to

1555
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:44,790
individuals they cannot legally own them

1556
01:01:44,790 --> 01:01:47,480
there's also a restriction across not

1557
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:51,570
that's certain convicted felons can't

1558
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:55,820
own them yes sir a normal unconvicted

1559
01:01:55,820 --> 01:02:00,750
person myself sitting in my home can I

1560
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:04,260
own a gun yes your honor I would presume

1561
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:08,820
so if I were to take this CAD program

1562
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:11,130
and create a gun

1563
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:14,790
other than this law would I be breaking

1564
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:17,550
any other law you would not your honor

1565
01:02:17,550 --> 01:02:19,620
and we believe that the G V so why is

1566
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:22,350
this an instrumentality of a crime of

1567
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:25,380
criminal conduct it's the person who

1568
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:28,410
uses it illegally who's committing the

1569
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:30,810
crime it's not the program committing

1570
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:32,940
the crime well your honor we believe the

1571
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:34,530
internet is important to distinguish

1572
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:37,740
here because on the internet there are

1573
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:39,330
proximately by our calculations about

1574
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:41,880
one in every four persons are prohibited

1575
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,010
from owning a firearm on those who have

1576
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,960
access to the Internet and under Federal

1577
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,240
Firearms ovulation we have one out of

1578
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,850
four Internet users or convicted felons

1579
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,770
I know your honor but children are also

1580
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:55,140
prohibited from owning handguns those

1581
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:57,630
handguns that petitioner wishes to put

1582
01:02:57,630 --> 01:03:00,330
freely on online and we would argue

1583
01:03:00,330 --> 01:03:02,580
what's the source of that statement Oh

1584
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:03,360
your honor

1585
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,250
according to recent census data there

1586
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:07,500
are about 75 to 80 million children in

1587
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,450
the u.s. who have internet access and

1588
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:13,619
there are a number about 5 to 6 million

1589
01:03:13,619 --> 01:03:15,890
felons and that's not even counting

1590
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:19,440
those citizens as whose non-citizens who

1591
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,670
are here in the United States who cannot

1592
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:22,350
own a gun so your argument is that

1593
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:25,050
because there are people who are not

1594
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:26,730
allowed we'll just call them bad people

1595
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:29,580
or people who are too young can't have

1596
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:31,860
this that the people lawful people

1597
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:34,500
should be deprived access why is it that

1598
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:37,740
just quintessential over breath Your

1599
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:39,060
Honor we don't think that the lawful

1600
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:41,570
individuals who can own this gun are

1601
01:03:41,570 --> 01:03:45,090
deprived of access the gvp a we'd argue

1602
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:47,940
does not is not a total ban on 3d

1603
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:49,590
printable gun files it allows for

1604
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:51,660
private communications and as justice

1605
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:53,970
Elrod you noted it even allows for a

1606
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:56,160
website to be posted and information to

1607
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,800
be disseminated to let people know that

1608
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,210
if they want these files they can

1609
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:01,950
distribute them privately but not

1610
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:04,380
publicly in an area where children and

1611
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:07,320
felons can download these files at a

1612
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:11,220
whim if they want to and possess a 3d

1613
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:13,619
printable gun well so why isn't it that

1614
01:04:13,619 --> 01:04:18,240
you didn't regulate that activity why a

1615
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,940
total ban rather than one that says if

1616
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,790
you're going to share a file you have to

1617
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:26,090
have that person identify themselves

1618
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:28,590
Your Honor we think in the context of

1619
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:30,600
gun regulations it's important to have

1620
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,660
both preventive and remedial measures

1621
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:35,609
this court in the federal federal

1622
01:04:35,609 --> 01:04:37,619
firearm regulations have recognized this

1623
01:04:37,619 --> 01:04:40,080
not only banning the distribution of

1624
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:43,109
guns generally and also not simply

1625
01:04:43,109 --> 01:04:45,750
requiring registration of firearms after

1626
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:48,119
they're given to from a federal firearm

1627
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:50,100
dealer to an individual but they put in

1628
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:51,269
place a federal background

1629
01:04:51,269 --> 01:04:53,729
check the GV PA acts like that federal

1630
01:04:53,729 --> 01:04:55,279
background check in that it is a

1631
01:04:55,279 --> 01:04:59,099
preventative basis speech so if you

1632
01:04:59,099 --> 01:05:02,399
can't be you can't chill per protected

1633
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:04,709
speech you have to be left to Taylor

1634
01:05:04,709 --> 01:05:06,419
well Your Honor we do believe that this

1635
01:05:06,419 --> 01:05:08,369
is narrowly tailored in that it does not

1636
01:05:08,369 --> 01:05:10,589
touch all firearm design files it had

1637
01:05:10,589 --> 01:05:12,899
touches a specific subset and if this

1638
01:05:12,899 --> 01:05:14,909
Court were to grant full speech

1639
01:05:14,909 --> 01:05:17,099
protection and thus reject the integral

1640
01:05:17,099 --> 01:05:18,809
to criminal conduct argument that we

1641
01:05:18,809 --> 01:05:21,029
submit we believe that it would it's

1642
01:05:21,029 --> 01:05:23,339
important for the doctrine the First

1643
01:05:23,339 --> 01:05:24,779
Amendment doctrine that this Court has

1644
01:05:24,779 --> 01:05:29,039
proffered and read that that doctrine be

1645
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:31,769
adapted to deal with the intricacies of

1646
01:05:31,769 --> 01:05:34,140
this new technology most of them I have

1647
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:37,829
is that although you're talking to me

1648
01:05:37,829 --> 01:05:41,279
about various needs of the state the law

1649
01:05:41,279 --> 01:05:44,309
is written isn't even satisfying one of

1650
01:05:44,309 --> 01:05:47,159
those needs because is your adversary

1651
01:05:47,159 --> 01:05:51,869
correct that someone can put this cat on

1652
01:05:51,869 --> 01:05:54,869
a website or offer it and as long as

1653
01:05:54,869 --> 01:05:56,969
someone privately emails them for it

1654
01:05:56,969 --> 01:05:59,579
they can share it we do believe that

1655
01:05:59,579 --> 01:06:01,979
would be allowed under the GV PA your

1656
01:06:01,979 --> 01:06:07,769
honor so if it allows that what is the

1657
01:06:07,769 --> 01:06:10,169
ban accomplishing your honor the ban is

1658
01:06:10,169 --> 01:06:11,880
accomplishing something that occurred

1659
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,630
and aims just two years ago and other

1660
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:18,869
other instances where individuals who

1661
01:06:18,869 --> 01:06:20,909
would like to have these files at a

1662
01:06:20,909 --> 01:06:22,949
moment's notice can get them it also

1663
01:06:22,949 --> 01:06:24,809
disables all that gentlemen would have

1664
01:06:24,809 --> 01:06:28,979
had to do was to write to the petitioner

1665
01:06:28,979 --> 01:06:31,169
and ask him for a copy of the CAD and

1666
01:06:31,169 --> 01:06:32,489
that would have been perfectly legal

1667
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:34,559
your honor we think the delay here is

1668
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:37,049
important in the context of gun laws the

1669
01:06:37,049 --> 01:06:39,299
narrow tailoring is sufficient here

1670
01:06:39,299 --> 01:06:41,759
because it doesn't burden substantially

1671
01:06:41,759 --> 01:06:44,099
more speech that is then is necessary

1672
01:06:44,099 --> 01:06:45,839
for example the GV PA could have been

1673
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:47,880
written to cover those files without

1674
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:50,639
instructions to a 3d printer but the

1675
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:52,349
aims legislature decided to narrowly

1676
01:06:52,349 --> 01:06:54,569
tailored statute so that it wouldn't

1677
01:06:54,569 --> 01:06:56,579
confront the issues posed by the First

1678
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:59,159
Amendment doctrine but we do argue that

1679
01:06:59,159 --> 01:07:00,719
the First Amendment doctrine needs to be

1680
01:07:00,719 --> 01:07:02,519
changed in the context of this new type

1681
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:04,620
of speech if this Court were to grant

1682
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:06,810
protection to 3d printable gun files so

1683
01:07:06,810 --> 01:07:09,150
you're saying you can delay what for 48

1684
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:11,970
hours for 72 you can delay speech rights

1685
01:07:11,970 --> 01:07:13,590
for a certain time periods we don't

1686
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:17,130
allow the delay of First Amendment

1687
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:19,260
rights for time periods a or other

1688
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:22,200
fundamental rights except under very

1689
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:25,770
limited circumstances certainly Your

1690
01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:27,150
Honor this Court made that point clear

1691
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:29,220
in part Nikki stated that there are some

1692
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:31,170
rare occasions in which a law

1693
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:33,030
suppressing one-party speech may be

1694
01:07:33,030 --> 01:07:35,070
justified by an interest in deterring

1695
01:07:35,070 --> 01:07:37,290
criminal conduct by another and we think

1696
01:07:37,290 --> 01:07:41,850
in the context where a file like the 3d

1697
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:43,770
printable gun file that you hear can

1698
01:07:43,770 --> 01:07:46,770
automatically produce a firearm that is

1699
01:07:46,770 --> 01:07:49,260
the rare scenario that we have here and

1700
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:52,050
for that reason we urge this court to do

1701
01:07:52,050 --> 01:07:54,480
what it did in Denver and and carpenter

1702
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,400
and adjust its president in the face of

1703
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,500
technology that we've never seen before

1704
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:00,870
in Carpinteria this Court stated firmly

1705
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:03,030
that when confronting new concerns

1706
01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:04,680
wrought by digital technology

1707
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,120
this Court has strayed away from

1708
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,800
uncritically applying its prior

1709
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,900
precedent and for that reason we urge

1710
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:12,480
this court to understand that this

1711
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,760
speech if it is to be categorised speech

1712
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:17,640
is entirely different from any type of

1713
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:19,310
speech that this Court has seen before

1714
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:22,050
but if this court were to move on and

1715
01:08:22,050 --> 01:08:23,850
not adapt its precedent in applying

1716
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:25,859
intermediate scrutiny to 3d printable

1717
01:08:25,859 --> 01:08:27,870
gun files that are based on the

1718
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:30,000
functionality of the file rather than

1719
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,520
the idea our message is expressed we do

1720
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,439
think that we need to have produced a

1721
01:08:34,439 --> 01:08:35,069
minute please

1722
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:39,720
in assessing whether you've shown a that

1723
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:41,609
this law is necessary given the First

1724
01:08:41,609 --> 01:08:44,160
Amendment concerns that my colleagues

1725
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:47,520
have have raised I was struck by the

1726
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,800
points made by your adversary about the

1727
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:53,250
easy availability of 80 percent guns

1728
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:55,170
that can be assembled that are basically

1729
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:57,840
sold in a modular fashion and that can

1730
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:01,830
be put together they wouldn't escape

1731
01:09:01,830 --> 01:09:03,840
metal detectors I suppose to that extent

1732
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:06,000
they would be somewhat less worrisome

1733
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,970
but are readily available at the

1734
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:10,620
circumvent the state of aims

1735
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:13,080
registration system altogether we need

1736
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,840
to take that ready availability into

1737
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,469
account in assessing the

1738
01:09:17,469 --> 01:09:20,229
whether you've shown that this is a

1739
01:09:20,229 --> 01:09:23,198
necessary regulation in your overall gun

1740
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:25,809
control approach I don't believe so

1741
01:09:25,809 --> 01:09:28,089
justice Carney although there might be

1742
01:09:28,089 --> 01:09:30,339
one loophole in Ames's regulatory scheme

1743
01:09:30,339 --> 01:09:32,920
that does not permit the allowance of

1744
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,859
another loophole the GV PA was enacted

1745
01:09:35,859 --> 01:09:37,719
to close one loophole and the aims

1746
01:09:37,719 --> 01:09:39,549
legislature much like the New Jersey

1747
01:09:39,549 --> 01:09:42,969
Legislature can if it wants closed the

1748
01:09:42,969 --> 01:09:45,819
80% receiver loop but but this but this

1749
01:09:45,819 --> 01:09:47,799
loophole has First Amendment

1750
01:09:47,799 --> 01:09:49,059
implications whereas the other one

1751
01:09:49,059 --> 01:09:50,349
doesn't and that's why I'm asking

1752
01:09:50,349 --> 01:09:53,189
whether there can be a closer tailoring

1753
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:55,869
there certainly would be required if

1754
01:09:55,869 --> 01:09:57,849
this Court were to categorize 3d

1755
01:09:57,849 --> 01:10:00,039
printable gun files as speech a need for

1756
01:10:00,039 --> 01:10:02,019
closer closer tailoring and we do

1757
01:10:02,019 --> 01:10:03,670
believe that the GV PA meets that need

1758
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:06,460
because it is unlike statutes that this

1759
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:08,739
Court has recently struck down as

1760
01:10:08,739 --> 01:10:10,869
unconstitutional under both intermediate

1761
01:10:10,869 --> 01:10:12,789
and strict scrutiny for example in

1762
01:10:12,789 --> 01:10:14,530
packing ham this court noted that the

1763
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:17,579
statute there was vague because it left

1764
01:10:17,579 --> 01:10:20,619
sex offenders and those subject to the

1765
01:10:20,619 --> 01:10:24,369
statute in purgatory not knowing whether

1766
01:10:24,369 --> 01:10:26,050
they could access sites like Amazon or

1767
01:10:26,050 --> 01:10:28,539
Facebook here the statute is clear it

1768
01:10:28,539 --> 01:10:31,119
cabins its language its plain text to

1769
01:10:31,119 --> 01:10:33,519
specific files those with instructions

1770
01:10:33,519 --> 01:10:35,320
that can automatically print a firearm

1771
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:37,479
it also allows for alternative methods

1772
01:10:37,479 --> 01:10:40,210
of communication through email private

1773
01:10:40,210 --> 01:10:41,800
messaging and others those do you lose

1774
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:45,369
if we think this is content-based no

1775
01:10:45,369 --> 01:10:47,979
your on each restriction no your honor

1776
01:10:47,979 --> 01:10:50,289
we do not assume it is content-based

1777
01:10:50,289 --> 01:10:53,769
how do you meet scrutiny well your honor

1778
01:10:53,769 --> 01:10:55,150
in the first instance if this is

1779
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:56,710
facially content-based we believe the

1780
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:59,199
secondary effects doctrine can be used

1781
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:01,570
in order to send this regulation we

1782
01:11:01,570 --> 01:11:05,550
never use that doctrine outside of adult

1783
01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:09,519
businesses and and I'm not quite sure I

1784
01:11:09,519 --> 01:11:12,670
understand how we would apply it to this

1785
01:11:12,670 --> 01:11:15,460
situation that there is a portion of the

1786
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:18,820
population that might illegally use this

1787
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:23,070
gun there still a portion that won't

1788
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:26,849
certainly so in the secondary effects

1789
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:28,210
content

1790
01:11:28,210 --> 01:11:30,520
there's the existence of secondary

1791
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:34,000
effects that actually insist exists that

1792
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,770
justify a state regulation but why would

1793
01:11:38,770 --> 01:11:41,230
that doctrine apply here I see my time

1794
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:42,880
is expired if your honor would allow I

1795
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:45,130
will answer as quickly as possible we

1796
01:11:45,130 --> 01:11:46,690
believe the secondary effects doctrine

1797
01:11:46,690 --> 01:11:48,219
is applicable here although it's only

1798
01:11:48,219 --> 01:11:50,650
been it's only been used to uphold a

1799
01:11:50,650 --> 01:11:53,110
statute in the adult business concept

1800
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:54,640
context it has not been captained to

1801
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,830
that area this Court has analyzed

1802
01:11:56,830 --> 01:11:59,950
secondary effects under Rav and boos V

1803
01:11:59,950 --> 01:12:02,980
Barry and it is exactly necessary here

1804
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:04,870
because the G V P is justified by crime

1805
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:08,469
prevention a secondary effects aimed at

1806
01:12:08,469 --> 01:12:10,110
secondary effects like crime prevention

1807
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:12,489
your honor for these reasons we would

1808
01:12:12,489 --> 01:12:14,200
urge that this court affirm the lower

1809
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:17,310
court ruling thank you

1810
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:22,210
petitioners you have three minutes of

1811
01:12:22,210 --> 01:12:29,890
rebuttal are you addressing both issues

1812
01:12:29,890 --> 01:12:31,600
are just your issue yes your honor I

1813
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,580
have one point on each issue I would

1814
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:34,870
like to begin with the Second Amendment

1815
01:12:34,870 --> 01:12:38,260
issue again before this court the state

1816
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:40,900
does not really make an argument for why

1817
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:42,880
the law the restriction on girls is

1818
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,320
right to bear arms would pass strict

1819
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,239
scrutiny and to get into intermediate

1820
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:47,680
scrutiny and they rely on this notion

1821
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:49,900
that Heller split the Second Amendment

1822
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:52,570
right into a core and a non core but I

1823
01:12:52,570 --> 01:12:54,610
would like to read a brief bit of that

1824
01:12:54,610 --> 01:12:57,100
part of Heller at page 66 35 of that

1825
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:58,810
opinion it said that the Second

1826
01:12:58,810 --> 01:13:00,280
Amendment is the very product of an

1827
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:01,810
interest balancing by the people and

1828
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:03,460
whatever else it leaves the future

1829
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:04,300
evaluation

1830
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:07,000
it surely evaluates above all sir pardon

1831
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,860
me I surely elevates above all other

1832
01:13:08,860 --> 01:13:10,420
interests the right of law-abiding

1833
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:12,790
responsible citizens to use arms and

1834
01:13:12,790 --> 01:13:14,980
defense of hearth and home and the state

1835
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:16,719
reads this to create a sort of tear or

1836
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:18,640
tranche system who anybody who's not a

1837
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,739
law-abiding responsible citizen doesn't

1838
01:13:20,739 --> 01:13:22,750
have the full second Amendment right but

1839
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:24,310
in context it's clear Justice Scalia

1840
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:26,140
Justice Scalia was simply responding to

1841
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:27,820
Justice Breyer on the question of

1842
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,830
whether the interest of persons like

1843
01:13:29,830 --> 01:13:31,540
Heller could be elevated over the

1844
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:33,520
state's constitutional interests so that

1845
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,080
says nothing about whether others

1846
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:38,590
interests are similarly diminished as

1847
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:40,390
the state says that it should be here

1848
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:41,090
and in

1849
01:13:41,090 --> 01:13:46,400
your adversary is making a slightly

1850
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,489
different more nuanced argument his

1851
01:13:49,489 --> 01:13:51,699
argument is not that there's a tear in

1852
01:13:51,699 --> 01:13:54,349
constitutional rights but that the

1853
01:13:54,349 --> 01:13:57,679
source of the state's power comes from a

1854
01:13:57,679 --> 01:14:00,849
different source and that the source of

1855
01:14:00,849 --> 01:14:03,739
prohibiting felons from possessing

1856
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:06,880
firearms comes from the police source

1857
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:10,250
the First Amendment on the other hand is

1858
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:13,310
not a part of the policing power it's

1859
01:14:13,310 --> 01:14:15,739
part of the marketplace of ideas to

1860
01:14:15,739 --> 01:14:19,790
which even felons participates because

1861
01:14:19,790 --> 01:14:23,690
they contribute and so if you view it

1862
01:14:23,690 --> 01:14:27,199
that way how does what remains of your

1863
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:30,800
two-tier argument Your Honor I think I

1864
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,420
would disagree that the state's argument

1865
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:34,790
as to the tearing portion really looks

1866
01:14:34,790 --> 01:14:37,219
to that felon non felon distinction but

1867
01:14:37,219 --> 01:14:38,780
in either event both the state's reading

1868
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:40,099
of Heller and the theory you've

1869
01:14:40,099 --> 01:14:43,219
articulated but runs afoul of the

1870
01:14:43,219 --> 01:14:45,110
principle this court articulated in

1871
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:46,790
McDonald that the Second Amendment is a

1872
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:49,250
fundamental right and it should not be

1873
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:51,199
treated cannot be treated indeed as a

1874
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:53,510
second class way turning to the First

1875
01:14:53,510 --> 01:14:55,070
Amendment point with my remaining time

1876
01:14:55,070 --> 01:14:57,320
the state again today as it did in its

1877
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:58,790
papers relies on a narrowing

1878
01:14:58,790 --> 01:15:00,800
construction of this statute indeed it

1879
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,239
does not defend the constitutionality of

1880
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:04,460
the law beyond that interpretation and

1881
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:06,500
we think that interpretation presents

1882
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:09,050
its own constitutional concerns namely

1883
01:15:09,050 --> 01:15:11,030
it would be a real chilling concern the

1884
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:13,070
state would read its statute to regulate

1885
01:15:13,070 --> 01:15:15,139
just some computer-aided design files

1886
01:15:15,139 --> 01:15:17,060
even though its text plainly

1887
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:19,280
criminalizes and imposes a 5-year jail

1888
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:20,989
sentence on the publication of

1889
01:15:20,989 --> 01:15:22,969
computer-aided design files the

1890
01:15:22,969 --> 01:15:24,710
regulated community here is we submit in

1891
01:15:24,710 --> 01:15:26,780
our reply brief understands that phrase

1892
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:28,639
to be the kind of files that do need

1893
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:30,170
alteration before a 3d printer can

1894
01:15:30,170 --> 01:15:31,909
understand them and therefore even the

1895
01:15:31,909 --> 01:15:33,590
state's narrowing construction raises

1896
01:15:33,590 --> 01:15:35,179
constitutional concerns of its own and

1897
01:15:35,179 --> 01:15:36,830
for these reasons we ask that the court

1898
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:40,270
reverse thank you

1899
01:15:43,390 --> 01:15:48,460
we are will retire to delivery

1900
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:58,060
[Music]

1901
01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:32,060
[Music]

1902
01:17:07,689 --> 01:17:31,119
all rise please have a seat

1903
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:38,510
well before we announce the winners and

1904
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:40,670
I don't know what the normal protocol is

1905
01:17:40,670 --> 01:17:43,130
the three of us want to make a few

1906
01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:45,890
statements so we figured after we

1907
01:17:45,890 --> 01:17:49,130
announce who won the rest of you

1908
01:17:49,130 --> 01:17:50,330
wouldn't be interested in sticking

1909
01:17:50,330 --> 01:17:55,430
around I said well take advantage well

1910
01:17:55,430 --> 01:17:59,320
the last time I was at Ames Finals was

1911
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:01,970
1991 before some of you were born I

1912
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:06,800
guess and this was a bad night for me

1913
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,830
because we lost it was a good night in

1914
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:12,200
many many respects and I learned a lot

1915
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:15,860
but we did not win but interestingly

1916
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:18,920
enough we had three judges on our panel

1917
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:23,480
we had justice Souter we had judge Taha

1918
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:27,950
and we had judge Patrick Higginbotham

1919
01:18:27,950 --> 01:18:30,290
from the fifth circuit and the reason I

1920
01:18:30,290 --> 01:18:32,030
tell you this is that it was a

1921
01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:35,030
two-to-one split decision and judge

1922
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:37,190
Patrick Higginbotham wanted it to be

1923
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:40,630
known that he had voted for our team and

1924
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:43,790
which was which was I was happy about

1925
01:18:43,790 --> 01:18:46,600
that but what I was really happy was

1926
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:52,400
that in 2007 I was named to succeed

1927
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:55,460
judge Patrick Higginbotham on the 5th

1928
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:58,060
circuit

1929
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:05,190
so I and I get to work with him still

1930
01:19:05,190 --> 01:19:07,050
now all the time because he's a very

1931
01:19:07,050 --> 01:19:09,900
active judge on our court but I tell you

1932
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:12,900
that so if you lose tonight you could

1933
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:17,940
replace one of us said answer and I and

1934
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:20,010
I hope you do and hope you do well I

1935
01:19:20,010 --> 01:19:22,800
want to thank you this you you could all

1936
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,840
do this for a living you should know

1937
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:27,360
that and be proud of the work that your

1938
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,310
team has done the briefing and the

1939
01:19:29,310 --> 01:19:33,360
argument superb the problem is a superb

1940
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:36,330
timely problem it is certainly not moot

1941
01:19:36,330 --> 01:19:40,080
in the first sense of the definition and

1942
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,810
I want to also express appreciation to

1943
01:19:42,810 --> 01:19:44,580
the members of the BSA who worked

1944
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:47,010
tirelessly and a Vaughn Smith who was

1945
01:19:47,010 --> 01:19:49,320
working here back when I was here and

1946
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:51,330
has observed our this school for 40

1947
01:19:51,330 --> 01:19:54,230
years so thank you

1948
01:20:02,219 --> 01:20:05,320
well I did not argue here but I was

1949
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:09,070
intimidated by this room and it's nice

1950
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:10,719
to be sitting on the bench as opposed to

1951
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:14,950
there yet this has been so much fun the

1952
01:20:14,950 --> 01:20:16,660
problem was really wonderfully crafted

1953
01:20:16,660 --> 01:20:19,090
it had so many interesting issues and

1954
01:20:19,090 --> 01:20:21,040
really challenging issues for both sides

1955
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,469
I loved reading your briefs and hearing

1956
01:20:23,469 --> 01:20:26,260
you tonight you were so poised and ready

1957
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:28,660
to parry with us whatever we threw your

1958
01:20:28,660 --> 01:20:32,530
way you didn't lose a beat you responded

1959
01:20:32,530 --> 01:20:34,870
you didn't lean on the bench and roll

1960
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:37,060
your eyes at a dumb question you just

1961
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:40,090
were patient and you all did really a

1962
01:20:40,090 --> 01:20:42,040
fantastic job and it was really just a

1963
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:45,850
pleasure to be here questioning you and

1964
01:20:45,850 --> 01:20:49,510
hearing the the fruits of your very hard

1965
01:20:49,510 --> 01:20:52,360
work overtime Harvard Law School is

1966
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:53,650
doing a good job and you're doing a

1967
01:20:53,650 --> 01:20:55,600
really good job so congratulations to

1968
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,719
you

1969
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:06,890
it's hard enough to do these arguments

1970
01:21:06,890 --> 01:21:10,040
when they're real when they're not

1971
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:13,820
McCourt's so you might wonder why do we

1972
01:21:13,820 --> 01:21:16,960
do them and we can tell you that we're

1973
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,240
altruistic that we don't want to help

1974
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,500
our alma mater z' and

1975
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:27,620
help students I admit the truth every

1976
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:30,680
time I come to one of these and I see

1977
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:34,040
the extraordinary performances of the

1978
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:38,360
students at these exercises it fills me

1979
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:42,350
with hope about the future it shows me

1980
01:21:42,350 --> 01:21:45,700
that you are being trained to think and

1981
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:51,160
to respond in extraordinarily loyally

1982
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:54,770
professional ways and that you carry in

1983
01:21:54,770 --> 01:21:59,330
your hands our future in a really good

1984
01:21:59,330 --> 01:22:03,350
way so I come here for you to give me

1985
01:22:03,350 --> 01:22:09,410
hope and so it's selfish of me I really

1986
01:22:09,410 --> 01:22:12,260
was incredibly impressed with each and

1987
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:15,590
every one of you you were prepared

1988
01:22:15,590 --> 01:22:18,170
you knew your case you didn't let us

1989
01:22:18,170 --> 01:22:22,400
rattle you you had thought through your

1990
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:25,310
strategy of presentation you stuck to it

1991
01:22:25,310 --> 01:22:27,440
you did everything we want a

1992
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:33,370
well-prepared lawyer to do thank you

1993
01:22:40,370 --> 01:22:43,980
the hardest part of this exercise for us

1994
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:48,060
is the judging because it's always so

1995
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:52,680
close it's usually a hair apart between

1996
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:56,100
the two teams just like tonight and we

1997
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:59,160
end up voting on little things that most

1998
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:01,440
people in the audience would really

1999
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:05,100
rightly call insignificant but when you

2000
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:09,180
have two so evenly matched teams you got

2001
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:12,750
to break the tie somehow and so we found

2002
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:15,480
little things to break it on but I do

2003
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:18,630
want to say that it wasn't from a lack

2004
01:23:18,630 --> 01:23:21,870
of superb performance by each and every

2005
01:23:21,870 --> 01:23:27,210
one of you having said that it was

2006
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:31,020
interesting this exercise it was and

2007
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:33,840
what I found so wonderful about it is

2008
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:35,940
these are cases that are going to come

2009
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:36,930
through the courts

2010
01:23:36,930 --> 01:23:39,390
they are wending their way through the

2011
01:23:39,390 --> 01:23:44,760
courts right now the first issue on on

2012
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:48,840
these CAD designs as one of you pointed

2013
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:51,990
out new jersey has a similar law and

2014
01:23:51,990 --> 01:23:55,590
that's already in the courts with

2015
01:23:55,590 --> 01:23:58,620
respect to the second issue it was one

2016
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:00,900
that was raised by a cert petition if

2017
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:04,710
not a year two years ago and so it's

2018
01:24:04,710 --> 01:24:08,430
down there percolating whether the fact

2019
01:24:08,430 --> 01:24:10,980
scenario that arises before us will be

2020
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:14,150
identical to yours or not I don't know

2021
01:24:14,150 --> 01:24:20,250
but each side had stronger arguments on

2022
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:22,640
one question weaker arguments on another

2023
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:26,630
and it was a really well-done exercise

2024
01:24:26,630 --> 01:24:29,700
having said all of that please remember

2025
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:33,270
that by choosing a winner of each

2026
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:36,300
category it should mean nothing to the

2027
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:39,180
person we haven't chosen you perform

2028
01:24:39,180 --> 01:24:45,590
just as well the difference was a slice

2029
01:24:47,790 --> 01:24:55,650
I couldn't help that best arles Matt

2030
01:24:55,650 --> 01:24:58,489

01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:53,429
teammates who worked so hard to put this

2036
01:25:53,429 --> 01:25:56,969
together to all the faculty and judges

2037
01:25:56,969 --> 01:25:59,639
who were a part of the various stages of

2038
01:25:59,639 --> 01:26:02,749
the competition to all the participants

2039
01:26:02,749 --> 01:26:05,699
this kind of teamwork is something that

2040
01:26:05,699 --> 01:26:07,199
stays with you for life

2041
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:10,980
judge Elrod told you her story but she's

2042
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:13,889
absolutely right those who weren't

2043
01:26:13,889 --> 01:26:17,670

2044
01:26:17,670 --> 01:26:19,769
important positions some day and

2045
01:26:19,769 --> 01:26:22,980
remember her story thank you all for a

2046
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:25,550
